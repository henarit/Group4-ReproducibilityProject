# Reproducing the paper "Deep Learning with Multimodal Representation for Pancancer Prognosis Prediction"

This repository contains an Ipython notebook written by Henar Rituerto, Johan Sundstr√∂m and Patricia Enriquez, as part of our reproducibility project for the Deep Learning Course (CS4240) at TU Delft. There, we explain the steps to try to reproduce the paper "Deep Learning with Multimodal Representation for Pancancer Prognosis Prediction" by A. Cheerla and O. Gevaert (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i446/5529139). 

For our reproduction work, we use as a base the code provided by the authors of the paper, which can be accessed through https://github.com/gevaertlab/MultimodalPrognosis. We performed all the modifications, the training and testing using a notebook via Google Colab.

The code we used is found in this repository in the folder /code.
